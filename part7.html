            This section will cover the various design attempts on an Arduino Nano. I would have used a simulation<br>
            software called TinkerCad, but it lags far too much on my laptop to be all that useful. Instead I have<br>
            built the circuits up in stages in real life. I will be recycling an older project that used a Nano as<br>
            I find it easier to breadboard small scale circuits with a Nano, plus the recycled project already has<br>
            two homemade RGB LEDs fixed in.<br>

        <h3>Stage 1: Cycling between Multiple LEDs</h3>
        <p><kbd>
            The first part of this is to set up a Button circuit: a button between logic High and the Input pin<br>
            and a large resistor between the Input pin and Ground, so as to return the Input to Low when the button<br>
            is open, without shorting 5V to ground and setting your microcontroller on fire. Its a questionable but<br>
            good habit to occasionally touch the main IC (or the Regulator unit on larger boards) every now and then,<br>
            just to tell if you have accidentally shorted the entire microcontroller. From past experience this has<br>
            saved quite a number of Microcontrollers from my carelessly improvised wiring.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Next, set up some LEDs and a few limiting resistors, on the Nano I'm using this comes in the form of a<br>
            sawn off 10K Variable resistor and all the LEDs being Active-Low. The LED bank is tied to a shared 5V pin<br>
            which was also used to power a small OLED screen, which has been removed to show the absolute mess of wires.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now comes the code. The code here is somewhat messy, but its arranged to make this slightly easier to modify<br>
            and pile on more stuff later on. On the left you will see all the initialisation, the ones Highlighted are<br>
            all that matter for this stage. On the right you will see the structure for the cycling process: Set an Integer<br>
            to be 0 to begin with, then everytime the button is pressed, the Input pin goes to High, Waits a few milliseconds<br>
            to account for any oscillation, and then increases the Integer by 1. By locking it in a For loop, it makes the<br>
            process run forever, and allows me to control exaclty how many possible states the Integer can have, When it<br>
            gets increased by 1, and what Triggers it to increase by 1. Also because it allows me to overclock and test the<br>
            loop by setting the Debounce delay to delay(1); <br>
            </kbd></p>

        <p><kbd>
            Originally, I just had 3 possible states, 4 if you count the OFF state, Int 0 meant all LEDs were off, Int 1<br>
            meant the Reds were on, Int 2 meant the Greens were on, and int 3 meant the Blues were on. Which was simple<br>
            enough, and even easier to add more stages if needed with the magical Ctrl C and Ctrl V.<br>
