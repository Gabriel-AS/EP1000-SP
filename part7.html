            This section will cover the various design attempts on an Arduino Nano. I would have used a simulation<br>
            software called TinkerCad, but it lags far too much on my laptop to be all that useful. Instead I have<br>
            built the circuits up in stages in real life. I will be recycling an older project that used a Nano as<br>
            I find it easier to breadboard small scale circuits with a Nano, plus the recycled project already has<br>
            two homemade RGB LEDs fixed in.<br>

        <h3>Stage 1: Cycling between Multiple LEDs</h3>
        <p><kbd>
            The first part of this is to set up a Button circuit: a button between logic High and the Input pin<br>
            and a large resistor between the Input pin and Ground, so as to return the Input to Low when the button<br>
            is open, without shorting 5V to ground and setting your microcontroller on fire. Its a questionable but<br>
            good habit to occasionally touch the main IC (or the Regulator unit on larger boards) every now and then,<br>
            just to tell if you have accidentally shorted the entire microcontroller. From past experience this has<br>
            saved quite a number of Microcontrollers from my carelessly improvised wiring.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Next, set up some LEDs and a few limiting resistors, on the Nano I'm using this comes in the form of a<br>
            sawn off 10K Variable resistor and all the LEDs being Active-Low. The LED bank is tied to a shared 5V pin<br>
            which was also used to power a small OLED screen, which has been removed to show the absolute mess of wires.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now comes the code. The code here is somewhat messy, but its arranged to make this slightly easier to modify<br>
            and pile on more stuff later on. On the left you will see all the initialisation, the ones Highlighted are<br>
            all that matter for this stage. On the right you will see the structure for the cycling process:<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Set an Integer<br>
            to be 0 to begin with, then everytime the button is pressed, the Input pin goes to High, Waits a few milliseconds<br>
            to account for any debounce oscillation, and then increases the Integer by 1. And repeat forever.<br>
            By locking it in a For loop, it makes the process run forever, and allows me to control exaclty how many possible<br>
            states the Integer can have, When it gets increased by 1, and what Triggers it to increase by 1.<br>
            Also because it allows me to overclock and test the loop by setting the Debounce delay to delay(1); <br>
            </kbd></p>

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Originally, I just had 3 possible states, 4 if you count the OFF state, Int 0 meant all LEDs were off, Int 1<br>
            meant the Reds were on, Int 2 meant the Greens were on, and int 3 meant the Blues were on. Which was simple<br>
            enough, and even easier to add more stages if needed with the magical Ctrl C and Ctrl V.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            what makes this structure good, is that you can squeeze just about any function into those states, So I decided<br>
            to add the tiny OLED back to the circuit, and output a little display that changed from one state to another<br>

            I even managed to Overclock this, to have 8 (0 to 7) possible configurations, and two switches that could configure<br>
            Each state in 1 of 4 ways, which would give a total of 28 possible states.<br>
            But after this, it became clear that I had to get more breadboard space.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <h3>Stage 2: Analog Reading</h3>
        <p><kbd>
            The next stage would be to read Analog levels on the arduino using LDRs, to give an even wider range of possible states.<br>
            I tend to think of this as more of Semi-Analog. It does input an analog value on the serial plotter, But it only gives<br>
            a useful integer range of something like 130 to 720. The hope is to use this range and split this into 4 ranges,<br>
            From 130 to 277, turn off all LEDs.<br>
            From 277 to 424, turn on the Red LED<br>
            From 424 to 571, turn on the Green LED<br>
            From 571 to 720, turn on the Blue LED<br>
            </kbd></p> 
        <p><kbd>
            I started this using a Variable Resistor, and I only just managed to capture a pulse on screen when it happened.<br>
