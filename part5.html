        <h3><kbd>The Wine Glass</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            Today, we will be designing a little Wine glass in Fusion 360. This would be fairly short as<br>
            it is a fairly simple shape, and I drew it entirely by rough estimation, so none of this was<br>
            measured. First, get a decent reference image on google, and start a sketch on one of the<br>
            Vertical planes, which will make the next steps easier.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Next, start drawing the rough side outline/cross-section using the Polyline or the Spline<br>
            function. Its fine if it does not look good, you can edit that later on by dragging points.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert spline here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-25.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now you can drag the points to form a slightly more elegant shape.
            </kbd></p>

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Be sure to finish off the remaining outline with the Polyline tool,<br>
            which will help form decent straight lines, and give a nice blue highlight.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Next, use the Revolve tool under create, to sort of pull the sketch around<br>
            a central point. Do switch to the Homeview so you can tell if its gone wrong.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Finally, use the Shell tool to carve a hole into the top of it, set the thickness<br>
            down to about 2-3, which is fairly accurate to most wineglasses.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Overall, I would say this one went quite well. This tooke me about 20 minutes.<br>
            I would not trust this to be anything close to structurally sound, but I am sure<br>
            this can be printed. The printer might include scaffolding between the bulb and<br>
            around the base of the stem.<br>
            </kbd></p>

        <h3><kbd>Turner's Cube</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            This next model is something that broke my ability to visualise 3D shapes. Turner's Cube is<br>
            typically a skill assessment project given to Machinists, as it poses an interesting design<br>
            problem that is not instantly obvious. I am now aware (after many attempts in fusion 360) <br>
            that you can produce this design with only a drill press or a lathe, given enough time and<br>
            precision. So after about 3 attempts in Fusion 360, I managed to design my own Turner's cube<br>
            with a slight modification at the end, to demonstrate the unique design capabilities of 3D printers.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            First, build a simple cube, I designed this with a 70x70x70mm cube, because anything smaller<br>
            would be too fragile and anything larger would take Hours to print and quite alot of filament.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert cube here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-29_16-36-28.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Next, sketch out a circle from the center of each cubeface, and extrude them down to produce these<br>
            circular recesses. it is important to be consistent with the dimensions, I tend to stick about 10mm<br>
            from the edge as it should give some level of structural stability when printing. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert cube holes-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-29_16-36-37.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now repeat on the other 3 sides to see the effect. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert cube holes again-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-29_16-36-58.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now repeat the same process again on the smaller cube faces, as many times as you like,<br>
            or at least as many times as your structure size allows. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert cube holes no2-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-29_16-36-48.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            And again on the other 3 cube faces
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            For this next section, I have chosen to sketch and cut square holes instead of a circular<br>
            one. I have absolutely no idea how to produce this design with a drilling motion as you can<br>
            only do circular drill holes on something like a lathe or a drillpress. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert square holes plan-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-29_16-36-33.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            After that, it was just a matter of selecting the various edges and giving them a small chamfer<br>
            of about 2 or 1.5mm, just to give it some more interesting surface designs. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            I should mention, this is the third attempt at trying to build a Turner's Cube. My mistake<br>
            the first 2 attempts was that I kept extruding the initial circular cuts all the way through,<br>
            instead of leaving those step surfaces to make it look like this half-fractal shape.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert disappointment no1-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-29_16-36-44.jpg" height="400"/>

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            But overall, I would say I am quite impressed with this one. It was a surprisngly simple solution<br>
            that took me quite a while to visualise. I can see why this would be quite challenging to reproduce<br>
            on an aluminium or wooden cube, you would have to get each cut exactly in the center, and at exactly<br>
            the right drill-depth, for all 6 cube faces, otherwise one of the corners would get cut clean through.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Other than being a neat little demonstrator, I make it a point to keep every <br>
            design I have,no matter how small or insignificant it may be at the time. <br>
            You never know when you might need to print a weird looking cube, and I am definitely printing this.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>The Cage</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            Today, we will be designing a small 3D model. This is a variation of the Turner's<br>
            cube, which fixes one of the main issues during printing which is straight Horizontal<br>
            lines, which a printer might not be able to do without extensive supports. This model<br>
            is designed to have as little straight unsupported horizontal lines as possible, while<br>
            still having an interesting shape. It also proved to be the limit of my laptop's processing<br>
            capabilities as just Loading the finished file is enough to set off warnings on my screen.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            First, extrude a cube, and punch a hole through all of the six sides of the cube.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">

        <p><kbd>
            Rotate the cube by 45 degrees in 1 axis<br>
            </kbd></p>

        <p><kbd>
            Now, copy the cube, and tumble it in another axis by 90 degrees<br>

        <p><kbd>
            Now, hollow a Sphere from the inside of the cube, so that it makes the gaps more visible.<br>

            Overall, this model only requires supports along 4 surfaces.<br>
