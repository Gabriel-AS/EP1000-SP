        <h3><kbd>Getting started</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            Generally there are loads of options when it comes to web design. You could go for the prefab services like<br>
            WIX or countless others, or build a website from the Bare foundations with HTML and CSS. There are advantages<br>
            and disadvantages from both categories, but they depend mainly on your personal preferences and comfort levels.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            As for me, I tend to prefer Brackets.io: a very basic, yet versatile HTML/CSS builder. I personally feel prefab<br>
            builders are abit too restrictive. But then again, there is a significant learning curve when it comes to HTML.<br>
            </kbd></p>

        <h3><kbd>Getting help</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            However, one strong advantage I found with working with a bare level, universally studied language like HTML:<br>
            You can Google anything about it.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            I personally recommend W3Schools, what I can only describe as a digital Textbook and reference for functions.<br>
            </kbd></p>
  
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert w3schools here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/Screenshot%20(9).png" height="200"/>
            </a></p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            And if you do prefer the comforting threads of software developers arguing over compilation errors and bugs,<br>
            then Stack Overflow might just be the place for you:<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
                <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">

            </a></p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            What I tend to do, is to have Brackets and W3Schools opened up in splitscreen. It is admittedly not the most efficient<br>
            setup, but it does get the job done. Again, there is no harm in having to google even basic syntaxes and formats, even<br>
            people in major development firms still have to go back to the basics. Any problem you might face, I can guarantee this,<br>
            not only have countless others experienced the same coding problem, countless more have found solutions to them,<br>
            and you can Google them<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            This entire website was built with HTML and CSS in Brackets, and despite the breathtaking number of issues I faced<br>
            trying to get it to work, W3Schools has proved to be a fantastic reference manual for using HTML and CSS functions.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            </a></p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            After that, it was just a matter of having a place to host it, and edit it in the future: Github<br>
