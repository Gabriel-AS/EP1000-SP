            For the final project, I am going to build an LED Nixie display. This is going to be heavily<br>
            influenced by the Cronixie project, but instead of a full clock display, I will just construct<br>
            one display, that can display the digits from 0 to 9, and can be controlled by a rotary dial.<br>
        </kbd></p>

            I intend to use 4 Ywrbot 3x3 RGB WS2812 matrix boards, I have found a dedicated library for them<br>
            and they can be daisy-chained up with little modifications to the code. The rotary dial can be a<br>
            simple Variable resistor tied to the analog read, splitting the range to 10 rough positions.<br>
        </kbd></p>

        <p><kbd>
            I will buy one or two of them from Sim Lim towers on my own to see if they can work, if they do<br>
            I can go back and get more on my own time. The other option is an 8x8 neopixel, if it is available.<br>

        <p><kbd>
            If I go for the 8x8 pixel, I can change the design to display something else besides Numbers, maybe<br>
            set image designs to create some animated effect. I need a matrix that specifically uses SMD leds as<br>
            they give off much more concentrated light than regular through-hole types, which is crucial in edge-lit<br>
            displays in clear acryllic. This project should focus more on Laser cutting and 3d printing.<br>

            This project should be simple enough that its possible to build,<br>

            So its been a few days, I have managed to find the 3x3 LED boards from Sim Lim. Every piece of documentation<br>
            I read about this warn that this module has the tendancy to draw a surprisingly high current, especially when<br>
            there are more than 10 LEDs connected. Since I will be running at least 30 of them, I need to rig a dedicated<br>
            power supply and a very big cut-off in the event I see smoke. I've bought 4 in case I accidentally burn one.<br>
            </kbd></p>

        <p><kbd>
            I will run the LED bank off a DC power supply, because I am not risking that much current through the Arduino.<br>

            First test: looking pretty good. I'll tidy up the code later. The LEDs are still addressed like a strip, with 0<br>
            starting from the bottom left corner, counting up to 2 on the top left corner, 3 in the bottom middle, and so on.<br>

            On the left half, at the top you can see the initialization code, I kid you not it is just 4 things,<br>
            Include the library, Declare the number of LEDs (count from 1 not 0, made that mistake), Declare the<br>
            data pin, that one CRGB thing, and the setup structure. Below that, I use a slightly inefficient loop<br>
            It just sets 3 leds to switch on and off together, then move up to the next row of 3, and repeats for<br>
            3 rows, as its a 3x3

        <p><kbd>
            On the right, is the lower half, the same loop. I tried that so I can just copy and paste it over and<br>
            over again, just changing the starting LEDs for each module because it starts countng from the bottom.<br>

            On both sides, same code, just counts Backwards and moves back down the rows. I want it to cycle forward<br>
            and then cycle back quickly. Same code, just subtracting the values instead of increasing them by 1.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now it needs a housing. I'm thinking of a 3d printed Light-blocker, to make sure that the light from one<br>
            LED does not bleed over into the next row, so maybe a grid, printed in black, and 100% infill. Attempt 1:<br>

            So, it's been a few days, I have modified some of the components due to some time constraints.<br>
            The first major difference is that locking mechanism for the LEDs. I did Laser cut the pieces,<br>
            but the beam was apparently not strong enough to cut through the 3mm acryllic clearly, which<br>
            meant that I had to get some pliers to snap the pieces off, which Seriously damaged a lot of<br>
            the critical components. It also meant that most of the precise slots and holes were essentially<br>
            useless, so I could either spend a few days salvaging the pieces, or move on and cut it all again.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            The good news, this prompted me to modify the initial Locking design because the smallest components<br>
            made it far too fragile to slam a big 3D printed plate through them. The biggest change is simplifying<br>
            what used to be 3 fragile Laser cut pieces and 1 massive 3D printed structure, down to just 2 decent 3D<br>
            Printed pieces, with large enough tolerances (of +-1mm) to account for irregularities in the LED boards.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            When compared to the earlier design, it does make me question why it needed to be that complicated to begin with.<br>
            </kbd></p>

        <p><kbd>
            ALso, I could print this in a much lower resolution because of the tolerances, which freed up more time for printing<br>
            a port for a Scroll wheel later on. For the imput, I went with a 10K Variable resistor to control the speed of the<br>
            number counts, but I could also reconfigure the system to control the colours in the LEDS if needed. In total, this<br>
            pushed the print time on Cura to a nice 2 Hours and 45 Minutes. Here's the Fusion 360 drawings,<br>

            That will sit neatly in a little rectangular cutout on the side of the box, and I'll use the old trick of Heating<br>
