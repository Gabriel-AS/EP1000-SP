            Today, we will be designing a small plaque in Fusion 360, and then autoCAD, for reasons<br>
            which you will see later on. This is from the video game called "Outer Wilds", this was<br>
            an obession of the ancient species, and all over the solar system they draw this symbol.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            First, we need our reference image. Import one under Insert, Canvas. Browse the file from<br>
            somewhere on your computer. I do not think it matters too much if its a Jpg or Png.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Pull the reference image to somewhere generally centered, forget about the scale for now.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            Now this is where it gets tedious, I decided to start tracing each barb individually.<br>
            There is probably a more efficient way to do this, but this is the way I chose to do<br>
            it because the Point Snap setting below allows you to estimate how a 3D printhead might<br>
            be restricted when printing the fine details.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            After about 40 minutes, I ended up with quite a neat outline of the design. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">

            Originally, I was going to extrude it and print it as a plaque, so I scaled it<br>
            up and extruded the piece to about 1cm thickness, and gave it a simple base 1.5cm thick.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">

        <p><kbd>
            It was about that point I started measuring the size of the smallest details,<br>
            the smallest triangles are about 0.15mm wide, while the 3D printer extruder<br>
            is about 0.4mm wide, which leaves me with 2 options: I can either Scale it up<br>
            further, or remove some of the small details. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            I decided not to follow through with either of them,<br>
            as the Printhead might start melting off the pieces it already laid down, and<br>
            the fact that this was already about 15 by 16 cm big, which from past experience<br>
            would take about 8 hours or more to print. Additionally, you do lose abit of detail<br>
            with 3D printing.
            </kbd></p>

        <p><kbd>
            So the next step was to upload the raw sketch in DWG form over into autoCAD.<br>
            </kbd></p>

            I think my next plan for this is to cut this out on a clear sheet of acryllic<br>
            and then again on a translucent colour like blue or green. I might insert the<br>
            coloured pieces into the clear piece. And maybe sandwich that between two blank<br>
            clear sheets of acryllic, seal it in with acetone to make it look like a hologram.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Its either that, or just engraving the design in on a light burn setting, and then<br>
            cut the perimeter out, so I dont end up wasting too much acryllic. It would look<br>
            quite good on a clear sheet, then colour the engraved sections in with a blue/purple<br>
            whiteboard marker. But overall, I am fairly satisfied with the base design of it.<br>
            </kbd></p>
