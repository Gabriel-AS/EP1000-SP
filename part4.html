        <h3><kbd>Rasters vs Vectors</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            There are two main image design types: Rasters and Vectors.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Rasters are based on colouring each individual pixel on a canvas, so out of say a 2400 by 1080 pixel<br>
            canvas, its made up entirely of about 2400x1080 different RGB settings for each pixel. For the more<br>
            complex softwares, they add a 4th variable into the setting, opacity. This is great for preserving<br>
            the details and colour complexities in paintings and photographs, not so great for your Hard Drive.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Vectors on the other hand, are formed by listing a set of mathematical equations, that then indicate<br>
            to the system, to turn any pixel along this line to a certain colour or opacity. This is great when<br>
            precision matters more than the colours and the details, such as in Blueprints or 2D Autocad files.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Take these images for example:<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Aristotle roufanis here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-11_17-51-54.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p 
        <p><kbd>
            You might have to turn up your screen brightness. This is a by Aristotle Roufanis, "Alone Together"<br>
            Zoom in a little to see the level of detail in this. This image was edited likely with a Rasterring<br>
            software, because the level of line precision is far less important than the detail in the image. <br>
            Also, think about the memory storage behind this image, this is 1400 by 1049, unlayered, which means<br>
            1400x1049 different colour codes, across the entire canvas, could you imagine rendering this with only<br>
            equations. But if you zoom in close enough, you can see the individual 90 degree cuts, between each pixel.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Gimp here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-11_17-51-54.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            If this was used to guide the extruder of a 3D printer, you might not get a very crisp curve or line<br>
            on your product. not to mention, not all those pixels are entirely #000000 Black, which might give the<br>
            printer some ambiguity as to whether it should trace that pixel or not.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Inkscape here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-11_17-51-54.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            If this was used to guide the extruder of a 3D printer, there would be little or no ambiguity to the <br>
            printer. The instructions would be just be to follow the line marked out by this equation. Additionally<br>
            you can have a very fine level of angular precision and spacing, where 1mm is not a certain number of<br>
            pixels, but a mathematical definition based on the canvas.

        <h3><kbd>Raster or Vector</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            When it comes to applications, Rasterring on a software like Gimp would be fairly good at something such<br>
            as covering up photoshop mistakes, or smoothing out an image. While Vectors on a software like Inkscape or<br>
            Autocad would be better for guiding the head of something like a Laser cutter. Do use a Mouse for drawing.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>3D building</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            There are usually two parts to this process. You would first have to know how you intend to create the actual<br>
            object. If you are designing something fairly large, its recommended <strong>Not</strong> to 3D print it, as it would likely take hours.<br>
            Whereas if you only require something small, but with a very intricate 3D shape, then fall back to 3d Printing.<br>
            My rule generally, is to try to break the object down, and see if I can build it with several 2D pieces, or do<br>
            I need very intricate 3D details and shapes. There are some grey areas to this but for the most part, this works.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            If you intend to Laser cut your final project, you should design the entire project in separate stages<br>
            using Fusion 360. Once you are satisfied with the look, start splitting the pieces down, and record each of the<br>
            part dimensions, then redraw each of the pieces down in an Ikea Flatpack style in AutoCAD for later on.<br>
            The first two project designs as examples are listed under the 3D printing and the Laser Cutting pages.<br>
            </kbd></p>
