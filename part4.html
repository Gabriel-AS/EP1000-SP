        <h3><kbd>Rasters vs Vectors</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            There are two main image design types: Rasters and Vectors.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Rasters are based on colouring each individual pixel on a canvas, so out of say a 2400 by 1080 pixel<br>
            canvas, its made up entirely of about 2400x1080 different RGB settings for each pixel. For the more<br>
            complex softwares, they add a 4th variable into the setting, opacity. This is great for preserving<br>
            the details and colour complexities in paintings and photographs, not so great for your Hard Drive.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Vectors on the other hand, are formed by listing a set of mathematical equations, that then indicate<br>
            to the system, to turn any pixel along this line to a certain colour or opacity. This is great when<br>
            precision matters more than the colours and the details, such as in Blueprints or 2D Autocad files.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <p><kbd>
            Take these images for example:<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Aristotle roufanis here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_15-38-22.jpg" height="500"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            You might have to turn up your screen brightness. This is a by Aristotle Roufanis, "Alone Together"<br>
            Zoom in a little to see the level of detail in this. This image was edited likely with a Rasterring<br>
            software, because the level of line precision is far less important than the detail in the image. <br>
            Also, think about the memory storage behind this image, this is 1400 by 1049, unlayered, which means<br>
            1400x1049 different colour codes, across the entire canvas, could you imagine rendering this with only<br>
            equations. But if you zoom in close enough, you can see the individual 90 degree cuts, between each pixel.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Gimp here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_15-38-17.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            If this was used to guide the extruder of a 3D printer, you might not get a very crisp curve or line<br>
            on your product. not to mention, not all those pixels are entirely #000000 Black, which might give the<br>
            printer some ambiguity as to whether it should trace that pixel or not.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Inkscape here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_15-38-13.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            If this was used to guide the extruder of a 3D printer, there would be little or no ambiguity to the <br>
            printer. The instructions would be just be to follow the line marked out by this equation. Additionally<br>
            you can have a very fine level of angular precision and spacing, where 1mm is not a certain number of<br>
            pixels, but a mathematical definition based on the canvas. 
            </kbd></p>

            </a></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>Raster or Vector</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            When it comes to applications, Rasterring on a software like Gimp would be fairly good at something such<br>
            as covering up photoshop mistakes, or smoothing out an image. While Vectors on a software like Inkscape or<br>
            Autocad would be better for guiding the head of something like a Laser cutter. Do use a Mouse for drawing.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>3D building</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            There are usually two parts to this process. You would first have to know how you intend to create the actual<br>
            object. If you are designing something fairly large, its recommended <strong>Not</strong> to 3D print it, as it would likely take hours.<br>
            Whereas if you only require something small, but with a very intricate 3D shape, then fall back to 3d Printing.<br>
            My rule generally, is to try to break the object down, and see if I can build it with several 2D pieces, or do<br>
            I need very intricate 3D details and shapes. There are some grey areas to this but for the most part, this works.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            If you intend to Laser cut your final project, you should design the entire project in separate stages<br>
            using Fusion 360. Once you are satisfied with the look, start splitting the pieces down, and record each of the<br>
            part dimensions, then redraw each of the pieces down in an Ikea Flatpack style in AutoCAD for later on.<br>
            The next few project designs as references are listed under the 3D printing and the Laser Cutting pages,<br>
            but the first two will be listed below, The Wine Glass, and The Eye of the Universe.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>The Wine Glass</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            Today, we will be designing a little Wine glass in Fusion 360. This would be fairly short as<br>
            it is a fairly simple shape, and I drew it entirely by rough estimation, so none of this was<br>
            measured. First, get a decent reference image on google, and start a sketch on one of the<br>
            Vertical planes, which will make the next steps easier.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Next, start drawing the rough side outline/cross-section using the Polyline or the Spline<br>
            function. Its fine if it does not look good, you can edit that later on by dragging points.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert spline here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-25.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now you can drag the points to form a slightly more elegant shape.
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert spline here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-22.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert spline here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-07.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Be sure to finish off the remaining outline with the Polyline tool,<br>
            which will help form decent straight lines, and give a nice blue highlight.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert cutout here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-29.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Next, use the Revolve tool under create, to sort of pull the sketch around<br>
            a central point. Do switch to the Homeview so you can tell if its gone wrong.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert model here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-32.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Finally, use the Shell tool to carve a hole into the top of it, set the thickness<br>
            down to about 2-3, which is fairly accurate to most wineglasses.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert shell here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-39.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Overall, I would say this one went quite well. This tooke me about 20 minutes.<br>
            I would not trust this to be anything close to structurally sound, but I am sure<br>
            this can be printed. The printer might include scaffolding between the bulb and<br>
            around the base of the stem.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert shell here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-47.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        
        <h3><kbd>The Eye of the Universe</kbd></h3>
        <p><kbd>
            Today, we will be designing a small plaque in Fusion 360, and then autoCAD, for reasons<br>
            which you will see later on. This is from the video game called "Outer Wilds", this was<br>
            an obession of the ancient species, and all over the solar system they draw this symbol.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            First, we need our reference image. Import one under Insert, Canvas. Browse the file from<br>
            somewhere on your computer. I do not think it matters too much if its a Jpg or Png.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert menu here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-52.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Pull the reference image to somewhere generally centered, forget about the scale for now.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert ref here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-25-57.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now this is where it gets tedious, I decided to start tracing each barb individually.<br>
            There is probably a more efficient way to do this, but this is the way I chose to do<br>
            it because the Point Snap setting below allows you to estimate how a 3D printhead might<br>
            be restricted when printing the fine details.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            After about 40 minutes, I ended up with quite a neat outline of the design. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert trace here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-26-05.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Originally, I was going to extrude it and print it as a plaque, so I scaled it<br>
            up and extruded the piece to about 1cm thickness, and gave it a simple base 1.5cm thick.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert eou here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-26-08.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            It was about that point I started measuring the size of the smallest details,<br>
            the smallest triangles are about 0.15mm wide, while the 3D printer extruder<br>
            is about 0.4mm wide, which leaves me with 2 options: I can either Scale it up<br>
            further, or remove some of the small details. <br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            I decided not to follow through with either of them,<br>
            as the Printhead might start melting off the pieces it already laid down, and<br>
            the fact that this was already about 15 by 16 cm big, which from past experience<br>
            would take about 8 hours or more to print. Additionally, you do lose abit of detail<br>
            with 3D printing.
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert base here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-26-12.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            So the next step was to upload the raw sketch in DWG form over into autoCAD.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert 2d here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-15_16-26-15.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            I think my next plan for this is to cut this out on a clear sheet of acryllic<br>
            and then again on a translucent colour like blue or green. I might insert the<br>
            coloured pieces into the clear piece. And maybe sandwich that between two blank<br>
            clear sheets of acryllic, seal it in with acetone to make it look like a hologram.<br>
            </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Its either that, or just engraving the design in on a light burn setting, and then<br>
            cut the perimeter out, so I dont end up wasting too much acryllic. It would look<br>
            quite good on a clear sheet, then colour the engraved sections in with a blue/purple<br>
            whiteboard marker. But overall, I am fairly satisfied with the base design of it.<br>
            </kbd></p>
