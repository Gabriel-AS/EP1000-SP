        <h2>Operating the Machines</h2>
        
        <p><kbd>
            This section will cover everything needed to operate two machines, the laser cutter<br>
            (generally the same for most of them) and the 3D printer, specifically the Ultimaker 2+.<br>
        </kbd></p>
        
        <h3>The Laser Cutter</h3>
        
         <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Laser cutter-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-11_17-51-54.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            First, make sure you have your DXF loaded onto a thumbdrive, and ready to import onto the system<br>
            if it does not load after 2 tries, pull out your drive and let someone else use the machine.<br>
            Once it does load, align everything into the corner, with a margin of about 1-2mm from the edge,<br>
            If you are using the big one in that image, there is an analog stick on the right side you can<br>
            use to align the beam onto a specific portion of the workpiece. Remember to Zero and dry test.<br>
        </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            If you are using Plywood, generally a good idea to do a small testcut somewhere nearby to check<br>
            for any impurities in the material. Once you get the beam strength and speed settings corrected<br>
            close the hood and print. Acryllic does not really have any major worries when it comes to impurities.<br>
            Once it is done, wait for about 30 seconds for the fumes to vent out the back. They're not concentrated<br>
            enough to be anywhere near harmful, but it still smells horrible. If you are engraving on wood, a good<br>
            trick is to paste masking tape over the engraving area. This would prevent any burns/discolouration on<br>
            the wood aroun the engraving, unless you prefer that sort of rugged industrial look to it.<br>
        </kbd></p>
        
        <h3>The Ultimaker 2+</h3>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Ultimaker here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-11_17-51-54.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            We will start with this UI here, a slicer software named Cura, which is best used with a mouse<br>
            unless you have the finger dexterity of a surgeon with your trackpad.<br>
        </kbd></p>
        <h3>The Ultimaker 2+</h3>
        <p><a href= "/Users/STARGAZER/Desktop/DFAB/photo_2020-04-27_07-54-03.jpg">
            <img alt="-Insert Cura here-" src= "https://gabriel-as.github.io/EP1000-SP/photo_2020-05-11_17-51-54.jpg" height="400"/>
            </a></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Import your STL file from your computer, and have it Scaled, Positioned, and Rotated if necessary,<br>
            using the Panel on the left. Open up the Custom settings on the left for better control over the unit.<br>
        </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Once you hit slice, the estimated print time will be shown, and if you preview it, you can inspect<br>
            each individual layer. If the estimated print time exceeds the time it takes to become bored, you<br>
            can assume a trial and error strategy and mess around with the various settings to shorten the time.<br>
        </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            <strong>Rafting, is it necessary? </strong><br>
            Yes, even a small item will jerk around and mess up the print.<br>
            <strong>Supports, are they necessary everywhere? </strong><br>
            Depends on the structure, I tend to leave it on anything overhanging more than 50-60 degrees.<br>
            <strong>Infill, does it need to be as dense as a brick? </strong><br>
            Depends on the purpose, if it needs to be a functioning support piece, best to keep infill at 70-90.<br>
            If not, you can drop the infil down to about 20-30 if its something decorative like that Lotus.<br>
            <strong>Scale, does a model of the Starship need to be a 1.1 scale model?</strong><br>
            Entirely based on personal preference. Do remember that the smaller you print, the less details there<br>
            will be on the actual model. If your printing something like an Apollo Lander, the smaller scale means<br>
            the antennas and stuff might just become a little blob.<br>
        </kbd></p>
        <p><kbd>
            Now, load the final project file into the dedicated SD cards, select your printjob, click print, and<br>
            sit back for about 3 hours.<br>
        </kbd></p>
